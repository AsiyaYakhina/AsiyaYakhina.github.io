		<p>Wellesley campus offers a lot of different study places, yet many students either don't know about them or don't realize what would be a perfect study spot for a particular situation. </p>

				<p>A mobile application that suggests a perfect study spot based on the user’s personal preferences.

<p>We’ve interviewed multiple students to determine what factors influence their choice of a study place. We found that users care about the type of space (study area for better concentration or lounge for a more social and lively experience). Some other common decision factors were the sound level in the space, available resources, space capacity, a sense of novelty  or food availability.
</p>
<p>
Based on the interviews, we’ve come up with potential tasks that users might have. This is a Hierarchy Task Analysis diagram of one possible task:

					<h3 class="popup-title">Wireframing</h3>
				</div>
		<p>Having analyzed users’ desires and the task domain, we started wireframing. We came up with two designs. Both designs include an optional filtering option that contains preferences that fewer students found useful. </p>
		<p>Design #1 presents the user with three starting questions (space type, noise level, and hunger) and allows to add more preferences under the “More” button. The app then generates one location that applies to the selected preferences. From there, the user can either choose to navigate to the given location or press the “Refresh” button to see another suggestion. We hoped that this version might appeal to users who want one suggestion, instead of a long list of options.

		<p>Design #2 has even fewer set of starting questions (space type and noise level) and a filtering option that appears with the list of generated suggestions. This design would appeal more to users who want to have more control and prefer access to more information. </p>

		<p>We tested both of our designs with the users and found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users had an easy time entering preferences based on the given tasks</li>
<li>Users preferred to have more study space options to choose from, instead of just one suggestion</li>
<li>One user thought that the “Filter” button is a label</li>
<li>Some users haven’t even noticed the “Filter” button</li>
</ul>

<p>Having considered the results of A/B testing, we adopted design 2 with the following modifications:</p>
<ul><li>The “Filter” button should be in bright distinctive color</li>
<li>The label of the “Filter” button should be more descriptive of its function. For example, “Filter your search” or “Add filters”</li>
</ul>
