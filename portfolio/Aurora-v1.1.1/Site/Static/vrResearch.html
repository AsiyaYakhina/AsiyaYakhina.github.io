				<p>I worked on this project at the Mobile Experience Lab at MIT in the role of a research assistant and a UX designer. The project was focused on exploring the potential of immersive virtual environments in the context of spatial design. Our research was aimed at understanding how people communicate with each other and interact with immersive interfaces. To achieve that, we designed and implemented a prototype that allows users to collaboratively design a layout using Oculus Rift and Leap Motion.</p>
				<p>We identified key aspects of interaction within immersive virtual environments through pilot studies and user tests in different contexts. Our design yields to a variety of applications, focusing on the collaboration between a user and an expert, where expert can help the user solve spacial design tasks and make decisions in a shared virtual environment. The example use case explored in the project, is purchasing furniture and composing a room layout with the help of a design expert. As a result of our findings, we published a paper.
